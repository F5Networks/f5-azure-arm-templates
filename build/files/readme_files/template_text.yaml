# YAML Document that includes the custom text for each solution readme
## NOTE 1: YAML single quotes in single quoted strings are escaped by including an extra quote, so NIC's becomes NIC''s
## NOTE 2: If separation is needed between supported and experimental templates then use a new sub-key of name 'default' 
## for the default text and a sub-key for either supported or experimental, depending on what should be unique.
## title_text:
##   standalone_1nic:
##     default: 'Single NIC'
##     experimental: 'Experimental Single NIC'
## NOTE 3: parameter_list supports same style as note 2, using  'default' and template name as keys when parameter is unique for a solution

  standalone_1nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a single NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard Cloud design where the  BIG-IP VE instance is running with a single interface, where both management and data plane traffic is processed.  This is a traditional model in the cloud where the deployment is considered one-armed.'
  standalone_2nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a 2-NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure.  In a 2-NIC implementation, one interface is for management and one is for data-plane traffic, each with a unique public/private IP. This is a variation of the 3-NIC template, just without the internal NIC for connecting directly to the backend webservers.'
  standalone_3nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers.

    experimental: "This solution uses an ARM template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Active) in Microsoft Azure. It also allows you to choose to deploy the HA cluster with or without network failover enabled. With network failover disabled, the cluster is created in a limited *Active/Active* configuration and traffic groups are not available; consequently, you cannot use connection, persistence, or session mirroring.  \n\nWhen network failover is enabled, the cluster is configured in a traditional *Active/Standby* mode. Alternately, you can configure multiple traffic groups in the traditional *Active/Active* mode to allow each device to process traffic for the traffic group to which it is associated. In both of these network failover modes, Azure load balancer probes determine which BIG-IP VE device will receive application traffic. Mirroring and failover are available in both scenarios."
  ha-avset: "This solution uses an ARM template to launch two BIG-IP VEs in an Active/Standby configuration with network failover enabled. Each pair of BIG-IP VEs is deployed in an Azure Availability Set, and can therefore be spread across different update and fault domains. Each BIG-IP VE has 3 network interfaces (NICs), one for management, one for external traffic, and one for internal traffic.\n\nTraffic flows from the client through BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard 'on-premise-like' cloud design where the  BIG-IP VE instance is running with a management interface, a front-end application traffic (external) interface, and back-end application (internal) interface. This template is a result of Azure now supporting multiple public-to-private IP address mappings per NIC. \n\nThis template supports creating up to 20 additional public/private IP address configurations for the external 'application' NIC to be used for passing traffic to BIG-IP virtual servers.  Each virtual server should be configured with a destination address matching the private IP address value of the Azure IP configuration receiving traffic for the application. In the event the active BIG-IP VE becomes unavailable, the IP configuration(s) are migrated using network failover, seamlessly shifting application traffic to the current active BIG-IP VE.\n\nThe template also supports updating the next hop of Azure User-Defined Routes (UDRs) to use the active BIG-IP VEs internal self IP address. Specify a comma-delimited list of managedRoutes and a routeTableTag in the template to define the UDRs to be updated.  All UDRs with destinations matching managedRoutes and configured in Azure Route Tables tagged with 'f5_ha:<routeTableTag>' will use the active BIG-IP VE as the next hop for those routes.  See [Post-Deployment Configuration](#post-deployment-configuration) for details."
  ltm_autoscale: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch the deployment of F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) Virtual Edition (VE) instances in a Microsoft Azure VM Scale Set that is configured for auto scaling. Traffic flows from the Azure load balancer to the BIG-IP VE (cluster) and then to the application servers. The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in single-NIC mode. As traffic increases or decreases, the number of BIG-IP VE LTM instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly.  Scaling thresholds are currently based on *network out* throughput. This solution is for BIG-IP LTM only.'

  rg_limit: 'This template requires that the resource group name the deployment uses to be no longer than **35** characters as a result of limitations to tag size within Azure.'
  nic_sizing: 'Because this template allows you to deploy a variable number of NICs, be sure to pick an Azure Virtual Machine instance size that can support the number of NICs you choose, otherwise the deployment will fail.  See the [Azure Instance Size link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/#size-tables) to determine the correct instance size to correspond with the number of NICs required.

  traffic_group_msg: 'Persistence and connection mirroring are now supported in this template.  It also supports mirroring of APM sessions, if the Access Profile is deployed in traffic-group-1.

Log in to the BIG-IP VE, and then click **Security > Options > Synchronization > Application Security Synchronization**.  From the **Device Group** list, select **Sync**, and then click **Save**.
