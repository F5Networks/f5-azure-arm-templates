This is the standard Cloud design where the  BIG-IP VE instance is running with a single interface, where both management and data plane traffic is processed.  This is a traditional model in the cloud where the deployment is considered one-armed.\n\nThe BIG-IP VE has the [Local Traffic Manager (LTM)](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality.

    title: 'ConfigSync Cluster (Active/Active): 3 NIC'
    intro: "This solution uses an ARM template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Active) in Microsoft Azure. It also allows you to choose to deploy the HA cluster with or without network failover enabled. With network failover disabled, the cluster is created in a limited *Active/Active* configuration and traffic groups are not available; consequently, you cannot use connection, persistence, or session mirroring.\n\nWhen network failover is enabled, the cluster is configured in a traditional *Active/Standby* mode. Alternately, you can configure multiple traffic groups in the traditional *Active/Active* mode to allow each device to process traffic for the traffic group to which it is associated. In both of these network failover modes, Azure load balancer probes determine which BIG-IP VE device will receive application traffic. Mirroring and failover are available in both scenarios.\n\nThis template also configures an optional internal Azure Load Balancer (ILB) for forwarding traffic to the internal interfaces of the BIG-IP VE devices. The ILB will be pre-configured with either a per-protocol or all-protocol load balancing rule, based on the **internalLoadBalancer** parameter value.\n\nWhen using all-protocol load balancing, you can configure the next hop on Azure User Defined Routes (UDRs) to point to the private IP address of the ILB.  Deploy an IP forwarding virtual server on BIG-IP VE to accept this traffic and forward it to the destination.\n\nWhen using per-protocol load balancing, deploy a network virtual server on BIG-IP VE with a destination address that matches the secondary private IP addresses of the ILB load balancing rule's backend pool members.  Note: The all-protocol ILB is currently only available in preview; you must sign up through Microsoft to enable this functionality before deploying the template.\n\nThe BIG-IP VEs have the [Local Traffic Manager (LTM)](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality. This means you can also configure the BIG-IP VE to enable F5's L4/L7 security features, access control, and intelligent traffic management.\n\nFor diagrams of alternate deployment topologies, see [cluster 3 NIC alternate topologies](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/supported/cluster/3nic/alternate-deployment-topologies.md)."

    title: 'HA Cluster (Active/Standby)'
    intro: "This solution uses an ARM template to launch two BIG-IP VEs in an Active/Standby configuration with network failover enabled (the template now supports [multiple traffic groups](#traffic-group-configuration) which enables active/active deployments). Each pair of BIG-IP VEs is deployed in an Azure Availability Set, and can therefore be spread across different update and fault domains. Each BIG-IP VE has 3 network interfaces (NICs), one for management, one for external traffic, and one for internal traffic.\n\nTraffic flows from the client through BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard 'on-premise-like' cloud design where the  BIG-IP VE instance is running with a management interface, a front-end application traffic (external) interface, and back-end application (internal) interface. This template is a result of Azure now supporting multiple public-to-private IP address mappings per NIC.\n\nThis template supports creating up to 20 additional public/private IP address configurations for the external 'application' NIC to be used for passing traffic to BIG-IP virtual servers.\n\nThe template also supports updating the next hop of Azure User-Defined Routes (UDRs) to use the active BIG-IP VEs internal self IP address.\n\nThe BIG-IP VEs have the [Local Traffic Manager (LTM)](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality.
