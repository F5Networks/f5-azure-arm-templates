## NOTE 1: YAML single quotes in single quoted strings are escaped by including an extra quote, so NIC's becomes NIC''s
## NOTE 2: If separation is needed between supported and experimental templates then use a new sub-key of name 'default'

  standalone_1nic: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch a single NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard Cloud design where the  BIG-IP VE instance is running with a single interface, where both management and data plane traffic is processed.

    experimental: "This solution uses an ARM template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Active) in Microsoft Azure. It also allows you to choose to deploy the HA cluster with or without network failover enabled. With network failover disabled, the cluster is created in a limited *Active/Active* configuration and traffic groups are not available; consequently, you cannot use connection, persistence, or session mirroring.  \n\nWhen network failover is enabled, the cluster is configured in a traditional *Active/Standby* mode. Alternately, you can configure multiple traffic groups in the traditional *Active/Active* mode to allow each device to process traffic for the traffic group to which it is associated. In both of these network failover modes, Azure load balancer probes determine which BIG-IP VE device will receive application traffic. Mirroring and failover are available in both scenarios. \n\nThis template also configures an all-protocol internal Azure Load Balancer (ILB) for forwarding traffic to the internal interfaces of the BIG-IP VE devices.  You can configure the next hop on Azure User Defined Routes (UDRs) to point to the private IP address of the ILB.  Deploy an IP forwarding virtual server on BIG-IP VE to accept this traffic and forward it to the destination.  Note: The all-protocol ILB is currently only available in preview; you must sign up through Microsoft to enable this functionality before deploying the template."
    
  ha-avset: "This solution uses an ARM template to launch two BIG-IP VEs in an Active/Standby configuration with network failover enabled (the template now supports [multiple traffic groups](#traffic-group-configuration) which enables active/active deployments). Each pair of BIG-IP VEs is deployed in an Azure Availability Set, and can therefore be spread across different update and fault domains. Each BIG-IP VE has 3 network interfaces (NICs), one for management, one for external traffic, and one for internal traffic.\n\nTraffic flows from the client through BIG-IP VE to the application servers. This is the standard 'on-premise-like' cloud design where the  BIG-IP VE instance is running with a management interface, a front-end application traffic (external) interface, and back-end application (internal) interface. This template is a result of Azure now supporting multiple public-to-private IP address mappings per NIC. \n\nThis template supports creating up to 20 additional public/private IP address configurations for the external 'application' NIC to be used for passing traffic to BIG-IP virtual servers. \n\nThe template also supports updating the next hop of Azure User-Defined Routes (UDRs) to use the active BIG-IP VEs internal self IP address."
  ltm_autoscale: 'This solution uses an ARM template to launch the deployment of F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) Virtual Edition (VE) instances in a Microsoft Azure VM Scale Set that is configured for auto scaling. Traffic flows from the Azure load balancer to the BIG-IP VE (cluster) and then to the application servers. The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in single-NIC mode. As traffic increases or decreases, the number of BIG-IP VE LTM instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly.  Scaling thresholds are currently based on *network out* throughput.
