## Introduction

<INTRO_TXT>

**Networking Stack Type:** <STACK_TYPE_TXT>

## Prerequisites and configuration notes
  - **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873 for details.
  - If you are deploying the BYOL template, you must have a valid BIG-IP license token.
  - See the **[Configuration Example](#config)** section for a configuration diagram and description for this solution.
  - See the important note about [optionally changing the BIG-IP Management port](#changing-the-big-ip-configuration-utility-gui-port).
  - This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
  - This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
  - In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template, you must create virtual server(s) on the BIG-IP VE.  See [Creating a virtual server](#creating-virtual-servers-on-the-big-ip-ve).
  - F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 ARM templates for Microsoft Azure and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughputs available for a specific tagged release. See https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/azure-bigip-version-matrix.md.
<EXTRA_PREREQS>

## Security
This ARM template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the template and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#securitydetail) for the exact code.
In the *variables* section:
  - In the *verifyHash* variable: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature.
  - In the *installCloudLibs* variable: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
  - In the *installCloudLibs* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.


Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014.

## Supported BIG-IP versions
The following is a map that shows the available options for the template parameter **bigIpVersion** as it corresponds to the BIG-IP version itself. Only the latest version of BIG-IP VE is posted in the Azure Marketplace. For older versions, see downloads.f5.com.

## Documentation

The ***BIG-IP Virtual Edition and Microsoft Azure: Setup*** guide (https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-1-0.html) describes how to create a single NIC and multi-NIC BIG-IP without using an ARM template.

### Service Discovery
Once you launch your BIG-IP instance using the ARM template, you can use the Service Discovery iApp template on the BIG-IP VE to automatically update pool members based on auto-scaled cloud application hosts.  In the iApp template, you enter information about your cloud environment, including the tag key and tag value for the pool members you want to include, and then the BIG-IP VE programmatically discovers (or removes) members using those tags.

#### Tagging
In Microsoft Azure, you have three options for tagging objects that the Service Discovery iApp uses. Note that you select public or private IP addresses within the iApp.
  - *Tag a VM resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the primary NIC configured for the tagged VM.
  - *Tag a NIC resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the tagged NIC.  Use this option if you want to use the secondary NIC of a VM in the pool.
  - *Tag a Virtual Machine Scale Set resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary private IP address for the primary NIC configured for each Scale Set instance.  Note you must select Private IP addresses in the iApp template if you are tagging a Scale Set.

The iApp first looks for NIC resources with the tags you specify.  If it finds NICs with the proper tags, it does not look for VM resources. If it does not find NIC resources, it looks for VM resources with the proper tags. In either case, it then looks for Scale Set resources with the proper tags.

**Important**: Make sure the tags and IP addresses you use are unique. You should not tag multiple Azure nodes with the same key/tag combination if those nodes use the same IP address.

To launch the template:
  1.	From the BIG-IP VE web-based Configuration utility, on the Main tab, click **iApps > Application Services > Create**.
  2.	In the **Name** field, give the template a unique name.
  3.	From the **Template** list, select **f5.service_discovery**.  The template opens.
  4.	Complete the template with information from your environment.  For assistance, from the Do you want to see inline help? question, select Yes, show inline help.
  5.	When you are done, click the **Finished** button.

## Deploying Custom Configuration to the BIG-IP (Azure Virtual Machine)

Once the solution has been deployed there may be a need to perform some additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  This can be accomplished via traditional methods such as via the GUI, logging into the CLI or using the REST API.  However, depending on the requirements it might be preferred to perform this custom configuration as a part of the initial deployment of the solution.  This can be accomplished in the below manner.

Within the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template there is a variable called **customConfig**, this contains text similar to "### START(INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION", that can be replaced with custom shell scripting to perform additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  An example of what it would look like to configure the f5.ip_forwarding iApp is included below.

Warning: F5 does not support the template if you change anything other than the **customConfig** ARM template variable.

```json
"variables": {
    "customConfig": "### START (INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION HERE\ntmsh create sys application service my_deployment { device-group none template f5.ip_forwarding traffic-group none variables replace-all-with { basic__addr { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__forward_all { value No } basic__mask { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__port { value 0 } basic__vlan_listening { value default } options__advanced { value no }options__display_help { value hide } } }"
}
```
### Changing the BIG-IP Configuration utility (GUI) port
Depending on the deployment requirements, the default management port for the BIG-IP may need to be changed. To change the Management port, see [Changing the Configuration utility port](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-0-0/2.html#GUID-3E6920CD-A8CD-456C-AC40-33469DA6922E) for instructions.<br>
***Important***: The default port provisioned is dependent on 1) which BIG-IP version you choose to deploy as well as 2) how many interfaces (NICs) are configured on that BIG-IP. BIG-IP v13.x and later in a single-NIC configuration uses port 8443. All prior BIG-IP versions default to 443 on the MGMT interface.<br>
***Important***: If you perform the procedure to change the port, you must check the Azure Network Security Group associated with the interface on the BIG-IP that was deployed and adjust the ports accordingly.

### Sending statistical information to F5
All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.  
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:  

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the customer ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- Azure region 
- BIG-IP version 
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name

This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent to F5.

## Security Details <a name="securitydetail"></a>
This section has the code snippet for each the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.

Note the hashed script-signature may be different in your template.<br>
