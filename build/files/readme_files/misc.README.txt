<POST_CONFIG_AUTOSCALE_TXT>{{## Post-Deployment Configuration
This solution deploys an ARM template that fully configures BIG-IP VE(s) and handles clustering (DSC) and Azure creation of objects needed for management of those BIG-IP VEs.  However, once deployed the assumption is configuration will be performed on the BIG-IP VE(s) to create virtual servers, pools, and other objects used for processing application traffic.  Because that information is unknown at deployment time, ensure the following tasks are done for each unique service to allow traffic to reach the BIG-IP(s) in the VM Scale Set.

### Post-deployment tasks (example application on port 443)
  1. Add a "Health Probe" to the ALB (Azure Load Balancer) for port 443, you can choose TCP or HTTP depending on your needs.  This queries each BIG-IP at that port to determine if it is available for traffic.
  2. Add a "Load Balancing Rule" to the ALB where the port is 443 and the backend port is also 443 (assuming you are using same port on the BIG-IP), make sure the backend pool is selected (there should only be one backend pool which was created and is managed by the VM Scale set)
  3. Add an "Inbound Security Rule" to the Network Security Group (NSG) for port 443 as the NSG is added to the subnet where the BIG-IP VE(s) are deployed - You could optionally just remove the NSG from the subnet as the VM Scale Set is fronted by the ALB.

### Additional Optional Configuration Items
Here are some post-deployment options that are entirely optional but could be useful based on your needs.

#### BIG-IP Lifecycle Management
As new BIG-IP versions are released, existing VM scale sets can be upgraded to use those new images. In an existing implementation, we assume you have created different types of BIG-IP configuration objects (such as virtual servers, pools, and monitors), and you want to retain this BIG-IP configuration after an upgrade. This section describes the process of upgrading and retaining the configuration.

When this ARM template was initially deployed, a storage account was created in the same Resource Group as the VM scale set. This account name ends with **data000*** (the name of storage accounts have to be globally unique, so the prefix is a unique string). In this storage account, the template created a container named **backup**.  We use this backup container to hold backup [UCS](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132) configuration files. Once the UCS is present in the container, you update the scale set "model" to use the newer BIG-IP version. Once the scale set is updated, you upgrade the BIG-IP VE(s). As a part of this upgrade, the provisioning checks the backup container for a UCS file and if one exists, it uploads the configuration (if more than one exists, it uses the latest).

**To upgrade the BIG-IP VE Image**
  1. Save a UCS backup file of the current BIG-IP configuration (cluster or standalone)
     - From the CLI command: ```# tmsh save /sys ucs /var/tmp/original.ucs```
     - From the Configuration utility: **System > Archives > Create**
  2. Upload the UCS into the **backup** container of the storage account ending in **data000** (it is a Blob container)
  3. Update the VM Scale Set Model to the new BIG-IP version
     - From PowerShell: Use the PowerShell script in the **scripts** folder in this directory
     - Using the Azure redeploy functionality: From the Resource Group where the ARM template was initially deployed, click the successful deployment and then select to redeploy the template. If necessary, re-select all the same variables, and **only change** the BIG-IP version to the latest.
  4. Upgrade the Instances
     1. In Azure, navigate to the VM Scale Set instances pane and verify the *Latest model* does not say **Yes** (it should have a caution sign instead of the word Yes)
     2. Select either all instances at once or each instance one at a time (starting with instance ID 0 and working up).
     3. Click the **Upgrade** action button.

#### Configure Scale Event Notifications
You can add notifications when scale up/down events happen, either in the form of email or webhooks. The following shows an example of adding an email address that receives an email from Azure whenever a scale up/down event occurs.

Log in to the [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com) and then navigate to the Auto Scale settings (**Subscriptions > Resource Groups >** *resource group where deployed* **> Providers > Microsoft.Insights > Autoscalesettings > autoscaleconfig**).  At the top of the screen click Read/Write, and then from the Auto Scale settings, click **Edit**.  Replace the current **notifications** json key with the example below, making sure to update the email address(es). Select PUT and notifications will be sent to the email addresses listed.

```json
    "notifications": [
      {
        "operation": "Scale",
        "email": {
          "sendToSubscriptionAdministrator": false,
          "sendToSubscriptionCoAdministrators": false,
          "customEmails": [
            "email@f5.com"
          ]
        },
        "webhooks": null
      }
    ]
```}}

<POST_CONFIG_TXT>{{## Post-Deployment Configuration
Use this section for optional configuration changes after you have deployed the template.

### Additional public IP addresses
This ARM template supports using up to 20 public IP addresses.  When you initially deployed the template, if you chose fewer than 20 public IP addresses and now want to include additional public IP addresses (up to the template-supported limit of 20) use the following guidance.  If you want to include more than 20 public IP addresses available from the template, see [Adding more than 20 Public IP addresses](#adding-more-than-20-public-ip-addresses-to-the-deployment).

#### Adding up to 20 public IP addresses after initially deploying the template
To add public IP addresses up to the template-supported limit of 20 after you have initially deployed the template, use the Azure Portal to redeploy the template, updating the parameters for the changes you want to make.  Use the following guidance:

1.	From the Azure Portal, click the Azure Resource Group where you deployed the template.
2.	Click **Deployments**.
3.	Find the deployment and highlight it in the list.
4.	Click **Redeploy**.
5.	For the Resource Group, click **Use existing** and then select the resource group in which you initially deployed.
6.	Enter the Admin password and Service Principal Secret parameters with the same values used in the initial deployment.
7.	To add public IP addresses, change the value of the **Number Of External Ips** parameter to the number of IP addresses you want to use.
8.	Agree to the terms and conditions.
10.	Click **Purchase**.

#### Adding more than 20 public IP addresses to the deployment
The deployment template supports creation of 1-20 external public IP addresses for application traffic (first one is used for external NIC Self IP).  Follow the steps below to add **more** than 20 public IP addresses to the deployment:

- Create a new Azure public IP address resource in the deployment resource group
- Create a new IP configuration resource (for example: *myResourceGroupName-ext-ipconfig9*) in the properties of the external Azure network interface (for example: *myResourceGroupName-ext0*)

When you create virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE for these new additional addresses, the BIG-IP virtual server Destination IP address should match the Azure Private IP Address of the IP configuration that corresponds to the Public IP address of your application. See the BIG-IP documentation for specific instructions on creating virtual servers.

}}

<POST_CONFIG_FAILOVER_TXT>{{## Post-Deployment Configuration
Use this section for optional configuration changes after you have deployed the template.

### Additional Public IP Addresses - Failover
This ARM template supports using up to 20 public IP addresses for the external 'application' NIC to be used for passing traffic to BIG-IP virtual servers. Each virtual server should be configured with a destination address matching the private IP address value of the Azure IP configuration receiving traffic for the application. In the event the active BIG-IP VE becomes unavailable, the IP configuration(s) are migrated using network failover, seamlessly shifting application traffic to the current active BIG-IP VE (the template now supports [multiple traffic groups](#traffic-group-configuration) which enables active/active deployments).   When you initially deployed the template, if you chose fewer than 20 public IP addresses and now want to include additional public IP addresses (up to the template-supported limit of 20) and/or if you want to add or remove the user-defined routes (UDRs) to be managed by the BIG-IP, use the following guidance.  If you want to include more than 20 public IP addresses, see [Adding more than 20 Public IP addresses](#adding-more-than-20-public-ip-addresses-to-the-deployment).

#### Adding up to 20 public IP addresses after initially deploying the template
To add public IP addresses up to the template-supported limit of 20 after you have initially deployed the template, use the Azure Portal to redeploy the template, updating the parameters for the changes you want to make.  Use the following guidance:

1.	Ensure that the first BIG-IP (VM 0) in the cluster is in an active state (from the BIG-IP Configuration utility, click **Device Management>Devices**, the device with the lowest IP address should be active).
2.	From the Azure Portal, click the Azure Resource Group where you deployed the template.
3.	Click **Deployments**.
4.	Find the deployment and highlight it in the list.
5.	Click **Redeploy**.
6.	For the Resource Group, click Use existing and select the resource group in which you initially deployed.
7.	Enter the Admin password and Service Principal Secret parameters with the same values used in the initial deployment.
8.	To add public IP addresses, change the value of the **Number Of External Ips** parameter to the number of IP addresses you want to use.
9.	To add or change managed routes, change the value of the **Managed Routes** parameter.
10.	Agree to the terms and conditions.
11.	Click **Purchase**.

#### Adding more than 20 public IP addresses to the deployment
The deployment template supports creation of 1-20 external public IP addresses for application traffic (first one is used for external NIC Self IP). Use the following guidance to add **more** than 20 public IP addresses to the deployment:

  -	Create a new Azure public IP address resource in the deployment resource group.  You ***must*** use the following syntax: ```<ResourceGroupName>-ext-pip<number>```.  For example: **SeattleResourceGroup-ext-pip9**.
  -	Create a new IP configuration resource in the properties of the external Azure network interface (for example *myResourceGroupName-ext0*).  You ***must*** use the following syntax: ```<ResourceGroupName>-ext-ipconfig<number>```.  For example: **SeattleResourceGroup-ext-ipconfig9**.
  -	Add these Azure tags to the public IP address resource:
    -	For example: ```f5_privateIp=10.10.10.10``` (the tag value should correspond to the new private IP address of the IP configuration that references this public IP address).
    -	For example: ```f5_extSubnetId=/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<myResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/*< myVnetName >*/subnets/<mySubnetName>``` (you can get this value from resources.azure.com: **Subscriptions > Resource Groups > myResourceGroupName > providers > Microsoft.Network > virtualNetworks > myVnetName > subnets > mySubnetName.id**).
    - An Azure tag with key **f5_tg** and value **traffic-group-1**, or the name of a different traffic group you have configured on the BIG-IP VE.
  - Again, you MUST follow the resource naming conventions in the provided examples for failover to work correctly.

When you create virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE for these new additional addresses, the BIG-IP virtual server destination IP address should match the Azure Private IP Address of the IP configuration that corresponds to the Public IP address of your application. See the BIG-IP documentation for specific instructions on creating virtual servers.

<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_TXT>{{### Service Principal Authentication
This solution requires access to the Azure API to determine how the BIG-IP VEs should be configured.  The most efficient and security-conscious way to handle this is to utilize Azure service principal authentication, for all the typical security reasons.  The following provides information/links on the options for configuring a service principal within Azure if this is the first time it is needed in a subscription.

_Ensure that however the creation of the service principal occurs to verify it only has minimum required access based on the solutions need(read vs read/write) prior to this template being deployed and used by the solution within the resource group selected(new or existing)._

**Minimum Required Access:** <SP_REQUIRED_ACCESS>

The end result should be possession of a client(application) ID, tenant ID and service principal secret that can login to the same subscription this template will be deployed into.  Ensuring this is fully functioning prior to deploying this ARM template will save on some troubleshooting post-deployment if the service principal is in fact not fully configured.

#### 1. Azure Portal

Follow the steps outlined in the [Azure Portal documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/) to generate the service principal.

#### 2. Azure CLI

This method can be used with either the [Azure CLI v2.0 (Python)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) or the [Azure Cross-Platform CLI (npm module)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli).

_Using the Python Azure CLI v2.0 - requires just one step_
```shell
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac
```

_Using the Node.js cross-platform CLI - requires additional steps for setting up_
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli

#### 3. Azure PowerShell
Follow the steps outlined in the [Azure Powershell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal) to generate the service principal.

<TG_CONFIG_TEXT>{{
### Traffic Group Configuration

This template supports associating Azure Public IP Address resources with up to two BIG-IP traffic groups, allowing each BIG-IP VE device to process traffic for applications associated with the traffic group for which the device is active.  
At deployment time, an Azure tag with key **f5_tg** and value **traffic-group-1** is created on each public IP address resource. Use the following guidance to configure multiple traffic groups.

  1. Select the Azure public IP address you want to associate with the second traffic group (in our example, the second traffic group name is **traffic-group-2**).
  2. From the public IP address Tags blade, select the **f5_tg** tag.
  3. Modify the tag value to **traffic-group-2** and then save the tag.
  4. From the BIG-IP VE management Configuration utility, click **Device Management > Traffic Groups > Create**, and then complete the following.
     - *Name*: **traffic-group-2**
     - *Failover Order*: Select the preferred order of the devices for this traffic group; F5 recommends setting the current standby device as the preferred device for this second traffic group, so that each traffic group has a different preferred device (device will become active after creating the traffic group).
     - Click **Create Traffic Group**. 

The public IP address resources tagged with **traffic-group-2** will be associated with the preferred device for that traffic group.
  
**Note**: The next hop for Azure user defined routes (UDRs) will follow the active device for traffic-group-1.
