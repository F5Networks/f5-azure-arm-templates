## Number of Network Interfaces
In many of our templates, you choose the number of network interfaces (NICs) you want your BIG-IP VE to include. Note that not all options are available for all templates. 

  - **1 NIC** <br>These templates deploy a BIG-IP VE with 1 network interface (NIC) for use in one-armed, simple network environment (the single NIC processes both management and data plane traffic).
