## Introduction

This solution uses an ARM template to launch a three NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Active) in Microsoft Azure. It also allows you to choose to deploy the HA cluster with or without network failover enabled. With network failover disabled, the cluster is created in a limited *Active/Active* configuration and traffic groups are not available; consequently, you cannot use connection, persistence, or session mirroring.

When network failover is enabled, the cluster is configured in a traditional *Active/Standby* mode. Alternately, you can configure multiple traffic groups in the traditional *Active/Active* mode to allow each device to process traffic for the traffic group to which it is associated. In both of these network failover modes, Azure load balancer probes determine which BIG-IP VE device will receive application traffic. Mirroring and failover are available in both scenarios.

This template also configures an optional internal Azure Load Balancer (ILB) for forwarding traffic to the internal interfaces of the BIG-IP VE devices. The ILB will be pre-configured with either a per-protocol or all-protocol load balancing rule, based on the **internalLoadBalancer** parameter value.

When using all-protocol load balancing, you can configure the next hop on Azure User Defined Routes (UDRs) to point to the private IP address of the ILB.  Deploy an IP forwarding virtual server on BIG-IP VE to accept this traffic and forward it to the destination.

When using per-protocol load balancing, deploy a network virtual server on BIG-IP VE with a destination address that matches the secondary private IP addresses of the ILB load balancing rule's backend pool members.  Note: The all-protocol ILB is currently only available in preview; you must sign up through Microsoft to enable this functionality before deploying the template.

The BIG-IP VEs have the [Local Traffic Manager (LTM)](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality. This means you can also configure the BIG-IP VE to enable F5's L4/L7 security features, access control, and intelligent traffic management.

For diagrams of alternate deployment topologies, see [alternate topologies](../../alternate-deployment-topologies.md).

For information on getting started using F5's ARM templates on GitHub, see [Microsoft Azure: Solutions 101](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/azure/Azure_solutions101.html).

**Networking Stack Type:** This template deploys into an existing networking stack; so the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying. See the [Template Parameters Section](#template-parameters) for required networking objects.

## Prerequisites

- **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See [K2873](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873) for details.

## Important configuration notes

> **_CRITICAL:_**  As of Release 6.1.0.0, BIG-IP version 12.1 is no longer supported. If you require BIG-IP version 12.1, you can use a previously released ARM template.  To find a previously released template, from the **Branch** drop-down, click the **Tags** tab, and then select a tag of **v6.0.4.0** or earlier.

- All F5 ARM templates include Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) v3.18.0 on the BIG-IP VE.  As of release 4.1.2, all supported templates give the option of including the URL of an AS3 declaration, which you can use to specify the BIG-IP configuration you want on your newly created BIG-IP VE(s).  In templates such as autoscale, where an F5-recommended configuration is deployed by default, specifying an AS3 declaration URL will override the default configuration with your declaration.   See the [AS3 documentation](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) for details on how to use AS3.   
- There are new options for BIG-IP license bundles, including Per App VE LTM, Advanced WAF, and Per App VE Advanced WAF. See the [the version matrix](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/azure-bigip-version-matrix.md) for details and applicable templates.
- You have the option of using a password or SSH public key for authentication.  If you choose to use an SSH public key and want access to the BIG-IP web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IP VE using the SSH key you provided in the template.  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IP VE to allow access if necessary.
- See the important note about [optionally changing the BIG-IP Management port](#changing-the-big-ip-configuration-utility-gui-port).
- This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
- F5 has created an iApp for configuring logging for BIG-IP modules to be sent to a specific set of cloud analytics solutions.  See [Logging iApp](#logging-iapp).
- This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
- This template supports disabling the auto-phonehome system setting via the allowPhoneHome parameter. See [Overview of the Automatic Update Check and Automatic Phone Home features](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K15000) for more information.
- This template can be used to create the BIG-IP(s) using a local VHD or Microsoft.Compute image, please see the **customImage** parameter description for more details.
- In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template, you must create virtual server(s) on the BIG-IP VE.  See [Creating a virtual server](#creating-virtual-servers-on-the-big-ip-ve).
- F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 ARM templates for Microsoft Azure and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughput levels available for a specific tagged release. See [azure-bigip-version-matrix](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/azure-bigip-version-matrix.md).
- F5 ARM templates now capture all deployment logs to the BIG-IP VE in **/var/log/cloud/azure**.  Depending on which template you are using, this includes deployment logs (stdout/stderr), f5-cloud-libs execution logs, recurring solution logs (failover, metrics, and so on), and more.
- Supported F5 ARM templates do not reconfigure existing Azure resources, such as network security groups.  Depending on your configuration, you may need to configure these resources to allow the BIG-IP VE(s) to receive traffic for your application.  Similarly, templates that deploy Azure load balancer(s) do not configure load balancing rules or probes on those resources to forward external traffic to the BIG-IP(s).  You must create these resources after the deployment has succeeded.
- See the **[Configuration Example](#configuration-example)** section for a configuration diagram and description for this solution.
- This template has some optional post-deployment configuration.  See the [Post-Deployment Configuration section](#post-deployment-configuration) for details.
- **NEW:**  BIG-IP version 15.X.X and higher now supports Azure's [Accelerated Networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli) on multi-NIC BIG-IPs. This feature is enabled by default. Read about requirements and how to check if Accelerated Networking is enabled [here](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/azure/Azure_accelNet.html).
- Previous tagged releases can be used to reference functionality that has been changed or removed.
- All templates now deploy Standard SKU Azure Public IP Addresses.
- The provisionPublicIp parameter controls creation of a public IP address on the BIG-IP management interface only. Please select a number between 1-20.
- The provisionPublicIPApp parameter controls the creation of an external Azure load balancer targeting the external BIG-IP network interfaces.  When Yes is selected, a load balancer resource is created and one or more public IP addresses are assigned to its front end configuration.  The number of public IP addresses corresponds to the number specified in the numberOfExternalIps parameter.  When No is selected, the numberOfExternalIps choice is **ignored** and no external load balancer is deployed. When selecting No to provisionPublicIp and Yes to provisionPublicIpApp, an outbound load balancing rule is configured on the external load balancer to provide SNAT for connections to the Internet.  You may remove this rule once the template deployment has succeeded.
- The provisionInternalLoadBalancer parameter controls the creation of an internal Azure load balancer targeting the internal BIG-IP network interfaces.  Selecting Yes deploys an internal load balancer with the HA Ports feature (all-protocol load balancing rule) enabled. NOTE: In order to download required libraries, the BIG-IP internal interfaces are not configured in the load balancer backend pool by default. You must update the load balancer configuration after deployment completes.
- All templates deploy Azure Virtual Machines and Virtual Machine Scale Sets into Availability Zones in supported regions; Availability Sets are still created in unsupported regions. Virtual Machine Scale Sets are distributed across zones 1, 2, and 3; failover Virtual Machines across zones 1 and 2. Standalone Virtual Machines are placed in zone 1 by default; however, you may select zone 1, 2, or 3 using the new zoneChoice parameter.

## Security

This ARM template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the template and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#security-details) for the exact code.
In the *variables* section:

- In the *verifyHash* variable: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature.
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.

Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see [checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github](https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014).

## Supported BIG-IP versions

The following is a map that shows the available options for the template parameter **bigIpVersion** as it corresponds to the BIG-IP version itself. Only the latest version of BIG-IP VE is posted in the Azure Marketplace. For older versions, see downloads.f5.com.

```


## Configuration Example

The following is an example configuration diagram for this solution deployment. In this scenario, all access to the BIG-IP VE cluster (Active/Active) is through an ALB. For diagrams of alternate deployment topologies, see [alternate topologies](../../alternate-deployment-topologies.md).

![Configuration Example](../images/azure-example-diagram.png)

## Post-Deployment Configuration

Use this section for optional configuration changes after you have deployed the template.

### Additional public IP addresses

This ARM template supports using up to 20 public IP addresses.  After you initially deployed the template, if you now want to include additional public IP addresses, use the following guidance.

#### Adding additional public IP addresses to the deployment

The deployment template supports creation of 1-20 external public IP addresses for application traffic (first one is used for external NIC Self IP).  Follow the steps below to add **additional** public IP addresses to the deployment:

- Create a new Azure public IP address resource in the deployment resource group
- Create a new, secondary IP configuration resource (for example: *myResourceGroupName-ext-ipconfig9*) in the properties of the external Azure network interface (for example: *myResourceGroupName-ext0*)

When you create virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE for these additional addresses, the BIG-IP network virtual server destination IP address should match the private IP addresses of both secondary Azure IP configurations assigned to the backend pool that is referenced by the application's Azure load balancing rule.


## Documentation

For more information on F5 solutions for Azure, including manual configuration procedures for some deployment scenarios, see the Azure section of [Public Cloud Docs](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/).

### Service Discovery

Once you launch your BIG-IP instance using the ARM template, you can use the Service Discovery iApp template on the BIG-IP VE to automatically update pool members based on auto-scaled cloud application hosts.  In the iApp template, you enter information about your cloud environment, including the tag key and tag value for the pool members you want to include, and then the BIG-IP VE programmatically discovers (or removes) members using those tags.  See our [Service Discovery video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig_pQ_tqvsI) to see this feature in action.

#### Tagging

In Microsoft Azure, you have three options for tagging objects that the Service Discovery iApp uses. Note that you select public or private IP addresses within the iApp.

- *Tag a VM resource*<br> The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the primary NIC configured for the tagged VM.

- *Tag a NIC resource*<br> The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the tagged NIC.  Use this option if you want to use the secondary NIC of a VM in the pool.

- *Tag a Virtual Machine Scale Set resource*<br> The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary private IP address for the primary NIC configured for each Scale Set instance.  Note you must select Private IP addresses in the iApp template if you are tagging a Scale Set.

The iApp first looks for NIC resources with the tags you specify.  If it finds NICs with the proper tags, it does not look for VM resources. If it does not find NIC resources, it looks for VM resources with the proper tags. In either case, it then looks for Scale Set resources with the proper tags.

**Important**: Make sure the tags and IP addresses you use are unique. You should not tag multiple Azure nodes with the same key/tag combination if those nodes use the same IP address.

To launch the template:

1. From the BIG-IP VE web-based Configuration utility, on the Main tab, click **iApps > Application Services > Create**.
2. In the **Name** field, give the template a unique name.
3. From the **Template** list, select **f5.service_discovery**.  The template opens.
4. Complete the template with information from your environment.  For assistance, from the Do you want to see inline help? question, select Yes, show inline help.
5. When you are done, click the **Finished** button.


## Creating virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE

In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers through the BIG-IP system, you must create a virtual server on the BIG-IP VE. To create a BIG-IP virtual server you need to know the private IP address of the secondary IP configuration(s) for each BIG-IP VE network interface created by the template. If you need additional virtual servers for your applications/servers, you can add more secondary IP configurations on the Azure network interface, and corresponding virtual servers on the BIG-IP system. See [virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal) for information on multiple IP addresses.

In this template, the Azure public IP address is associated with an Azure Load Balancer that forwards traffic to a backend pool that includes secondary IP configurations for *each* BIG-IP network interface.  You must create a single virtual server with a destination that matches both private IP addresses in the Azure Load Balancer's backend pool.  In this example, the backend pool private IP addresses are 10.0.1.36 and 10.0.1.37.

1. Once your BIG-IP VE has launched, open the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.
2. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and then click the **Create** button.
3. In the **Name** field, give the Virtual Server a unique name.
4. In the **Destination/Mask** field, type the destination address (for example: 10.0.1.32/27).
5. In the **Service Port** field, type the appropriate port.
6. Configure the rest of the virtual server as appropriate.
7. If you used the Service Discovery iApp template: In the Resources section, from the **Default Pool** list, select the name of the pool created by the iApp.
8. Click the **Finished** button.
9. Repeat as necessary.

If network failover is disabled (default), when you have completed the virtual server configuration, you must modify the virtual addresses to use Traffic Group None using the following guidance.

1. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers**.
2. On the Menu bar, click the **Virtual Address List** tab.
3. Click the address of one of the virtual servers you just created.
4. From the **Traffic Group** list, select **None**.
5. Click **Update**.
6. Repeat for each virtual server.

If network failover is enabled (if, for example, you have deployed the HA Cluster 3 NIC template, or manually enabled network failover with traffic groups), when you have completed the virtual server configuration, you may modify the virtual addresses to use an alternative Traffic Group using the following guidance.

1. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers**.
2. On the Menu bar, click the **Virtual Address List** tab.
3. Click the address of one of the virtual servers you just created.
4. From the **Traffic Group** list, select **traffic-group-2** (or the additional traffic group you created previously).
5. Click **Update**.
6. Repeat for each virtual server.


### Deploying Custom Configuration to the BIG-IP (Azure Virtual Machine)

Once the solution has been deployed there may be a need to perform some additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  This can be accomplished via traditional methods such as via the GUI, logging into the CLI or using the REST API.  However, depending on the requirements it might be preferred to perform this custom configuration as a part of the initial deployment of the solution.  This can be accomplished in the below manner.

Within the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template there is a variable called **customConfig**, this contains text similar to "### START (INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION", that can be replaced with custom shell scripting to perform additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  An example of what it would look like to configure the f5.ip_forwarding iApp is included below.

Warning: F5 does not support the template if you change anything other than the **customConfig** ARM template variable.

```json
"variables": {
    "customConfig": "### START (INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION HERE\ntmsh create sys application service my_deployment { device-group none template f5.ip_forwarding traffic-group none variables replace-all-with { basic__addr { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__forward_all { value No } basic__mask { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__port { value 0 } basic__vlan_listening { value default } options__advanced { value no }options__display_help { value hide } } }"
}
```

### Changing the BIG-IP Configuration utility (GUI) port

Depending on the deployment requirements, the default management port for the BIG-IP may need to be changed. To change the Management port, see [Changing the Configuration utility port](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/azure/Azure_singleNIC.html#azureconfigport) for instructions.

***Important***: The default port provisioned is dependent on 1) which BIG-IP version you choose to deploy as well as 2) how many interfaces (NICs) are configured on that BIG-IP. BIG-IP v13.x and later in a single-NIC configuration uses port 8443. All prior BIG-IP versions default to 443 on the MGMT interface.

***Important***: If you perform the procedure to change the port, you must check the Azure Network Security Group associated with the interface on the BIG-IP that was deployed and adjust the ports accordingly.

### Logging iApp

F5 has created an iApp for configuring logging for BIG-IP modules to be sent to a specific set of cloud analytics solutions. The iApp creates logging profiles which can be attached to the appropriate objects (virtual servers, APM policy, and so on) which results in logs being sent to the selected cloud analytics solution, Azure in this case.

We recommend you watch the [Viewing ASM Data in Azure Analytics video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3B_TOG5ZpA&feature=youtu.be) that shows this iApp in action, everything from downloading and importing the iApp, to configuring it, to a demo of an attack on an application and the resulting ASM violation log that is sent to ASM Analytics.

**Important**: Be aware that this may (depending on the level of logging required) affect performance of the BIG-IP as a result of the processing to construct and send the log messages over HTTP to the cloud analytics solution.
It is also important to note this cloud logging iApp template is a *different solution and iApp template* than the F5 Analytics iApp template described [here](https://f5.com/solutions/deployment-guides/analytics-big-ip-v114-v1212-ltm-apm-aam-asm-afm).

Use the following guidance using the iApp template (the iApp now is present on the BIG-IP VE image as a part of the templates).

1. Log on to the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.
2. On the Main tab, from the **iApp** menu, click **Application Services > Applications > Create**.
3. From the **Template** list, select f5.cloud_logger.v1.0.0.tmpl (or later version if applicable).

For assistance running the iApp template, once you open the iApp, from the *Do you want to see inline help?* question, select **Yes, show inline help**.

### Sending statistical information to F5

All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the customer ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- Azure region
- BIG-IP version
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name

This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent to F5.

## Security Details

This section has the code snippet for each the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.

Note the hashed script-signature may be different in your template.
