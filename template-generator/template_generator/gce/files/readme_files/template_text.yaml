    create_virtual_servers: "## Creating virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE\n\nIn order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers through the BIG-IP system, you must create a virtual server on the BIG-IP VE. To create a BIG-IP virtual server you need to know the IP address to use, which should match (or be within the CIDR range defined) of either a 1) GCP alias IP or a 2) GCP forwarding rule IP configured on the active BIG-IP VE instance. If you need additional virtual servers for your applications/servers, you can add more GCP resources, and corresponding virtual servers on the BIG-IP system. See [gcp-vpc-alias-ips](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/alias-ip) for information on alias IP ranges. See [gcp-forwarding-rules](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rules) for more information on forwarding rules.\n\nIn this template, each IP address is associated with a GCP object attached to the external network interface of the BIG-IP VE. Because this IP will be moved to the active BIG-IP device, you need to create a single virtual server in **traffic-group-1** that corresponds to the IP address of that object.\n1. Once your BIG-IP VE has launched, open the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.\n2. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and then click the **Create** button.\n3. In the **Name** field, give the Virtual Server a unique name.\n4. In the **Destination/Mask** field, type the IP address of the object to be associated with your application (for example: 10.0.1.10/32 or 80.80.80.80/32).\n5. In the **Service Port** field, type the appropriate port.\n6. Configure the rest of the virtual server as appropriate.\n7. Click the **Finished** button.\n8. Repeat as necessary.\n\nWhen you have completed the virtual server configuration, you may modify the virtual addresses to use an alternative Traffic Group using the following guidance.\n1. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers**.\n2. On the Menu bar, click the **Virtual Address List** tab.\n3. Click the address of one of the virtual servers you just created.\n4. From the **Traffic Group** list, select **traffic-group-2** (or the additional traffic group you created previously).\n5. Click **Update**.\n6. Repeat for each virtual server."

      default: "This solution uses a GDM template to launch the deployment of F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) and Application Security Manager (ASM) Virtual Edition (VE) instances in a Google Instance Group that is configured for auto scaling. Traffic flows from the Google load balancer to the BIG-IP VE (cluster) and then to the application servers. The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in single-NIC mode. Auto scaling means that as certain thresholds are reached, the number of BIG-IP VE instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly. Scaling events are triggered based on the utilization of the BIG-IP VE CPU (you configure the thresholds in the template), specifically the F5 TMM (Traffic Management Microkernel) CPU.\n In this solution, the BIG-IP VEs have the [LTM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm) and [ASM](https://f5.com/products/big-ip/application-security-manager-asm) modules enabled to provide advanced traffic management and web application security functionality.\n **Networking Stack Type:** This template deploys into an existing networking stack; so the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying.

When deploying the template, use the identity name from these examples for the **userAssignedIdentityName** input parameter.\n\nClick one of the following links for guidance on creating the managed identity:\n\t- [Azure Portal](#creating-a-managed-user-identity-from-the-azure-portal)\n\t- [Azure CLI](#creating-a-managed-user-identity-from-the-azure-cli)\n"

Use one of the following procedures to create a managed user identity.\n\n

### Creating a managed user identity from the Azure Portal\n
Use the following procedure if you want to create the managed user identity from the Azure Portal.\n

1.	Click the Azure Resource Group where you want to add the Managed User Identity.\n
2.	Click **Add**.\n
3.	Type **User Assigned Managed Identity** in the search bar.\n
4.	Click **User Assigned Managed Identity** and then click **Create**.\n
5.	Specify a name for the resource and choose a Resource Group where it will be created, and then click **Create**.\n
6.	Click the Azure Resource Group containing your existing Azure virtual network.\n
7.	Click **Access Control (IAM)**.\n
8.	Click **Role Assignments**.\n
9.	Click **Add > Role Assignment**.\n
10.	Under **Role**, select the **Contributor** role.\n
11.	Under **Assign access to**, select **User assigned managed identity**.\n
12.	Select the User assigned managed identity you created previously, and click **Save**\n
13. Repeat steps 6-12 for the Resource Group where you deployed the ARM template\n\n

The BIG-IQ system now has access to move Azure IP configurations to the active device.\n\n

### Creating a managed user identity from the Azure CLI\n
Use the following procedure if you want to create the managed user identity from the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest).\n\n

  - To create a managed identity, use the following command syntax from the Azure CLI:\n
  ```az identity create -n <identity_name> -g <deployment_resource_group>```\n
  - To get the object ID of the identity (the object ID is the \"value\" property (GUID) of the returned JSON object), use the following command syntax from the Azure CLI:\n
  ```az identity show -g <deployment_resource_group> --name <identity_name> --output json```\n
  - To create a role assignment for the identity on the existing stack resource group, use the following command syntax from the Azure CLI:\n
    ```az role assignment create --resource-group <existing_stack_resource_group> <identity_object_ID> --roleName \"Contributor\"```\n"
