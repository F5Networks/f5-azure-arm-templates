## Introduction

This solution uses an ARM template to launch a 2-NIC deployment of a cloud-focused BIG-IP VE in Microsoft Azure.  In a 2-NIC implementation, one interface is for management and one is for data-plane traffic, each with a unique public/private IP. This is a variation of the 3-NIC template, just without the internal NIC for connecting directly to the backend webservers.

The BIG-IP VE has the Local Traffic Manager (LTM) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality. This means you can also configure the BIG-IP VE to enable F5's L4/L7 security features, access control, and intelligent traffic management.

For information on getting started using F5's ARM templates on GitHub, see [Microsoft Azure: Solutions 101](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/azure/Azure_solutions101.html).

**Networking Stack Type:** This template deploys into an existing networking stack; so the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying. See the [Template Parameters Section](#template-parameters) for required networking objects.

## Prerequisites

- **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See [K2873](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873) for details.
- If you are deploying the BYOL template, you must have a valid BIG-IP license token.

## Important configuration notes

- See the **[Configuration Example](#configuration-example)** section for a configuration diagram and description for this solution.
- See the important note about [optionally changing the BIG-IP Management port](#changing-the-big-ip-configuration-utility-gui-port).
- This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
- This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
- In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template, you must create virtual server(s) on the BIG-IP VE.  See [Creating a virtual server](#creating-virtual-servers-on-the-big-ip-ve).
- F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 ARM templates for Microsoft Azure and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughputs available for a specific tagged release. See [azure-bigip-version-matrix](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/azure-bigip-version-matrix.md).
- F5 has created an iApp for configuring logging for BIG-IP modules to be sent to a specific set of cloud analytics solutions.  See [Logging iApp](#logging-iapp).
- F5 Azure ARM templates now capture all deployment logs to the BIG-IP VE in **/var/log/cloud/azure**.  Depending on which template you are using, this includes deployment logs (stdout/stderr), Cloud Libs execution logs, recurring solution logs (metrics, failover, and so on), and more.
- Supported F5 ARM templates do not reconfigure existing Azure resources, such as network security groups.  Depending on your configuration, you may need to configure these resources to allow the BIG-IP VE(s) to receive traffic for your application.  Similarly, templates that deploy Azure load balancer(s) do not configure load balancing rules or probes on those resources to forward external traffic to the BIG-IP(s).  You must create these resources after the deployment has succeeded.
- This template has some optional post-deployment configuration.  See the [Post-Deployment Configuration section](#post-deployment-configuration) for details.
- You have the option of using a [BIG-IQ device](https://f5.com/products/big-iq-centralized-management) with a pool of BIG-IP licenses in order to license BIG-IP VEs using BYOL licenses. This solution only supports only BIG-IQ versions 5.0 - 5.3, and your BIG-IQ system must have at least 2 NICs.

## Security

This ARM template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the template and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#security-details) for the exact code.
In the *variables* section:

- In the *verifyHash* variable: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature.
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.

Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see [checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github](https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014).

## Supported BIG-IP versions

The following is a map that shows the available options for the template parameter **bigIpVersion** as it corresponds to the BIG-IP version itself. Only the latest version of BIG-IP VE is posted in the Azure Marketplace. For older versions, see downloads.f5.com.

**NOTE**:  Due to changes within the Azure environment, only BIG-IP version 13.1.0200 is available (even if you select **Latest** in the template). We will update the template to include a new BIG-IP v12.1 image as soon as it is available.

| Azure BIG-IP Image Version | BIG-IP Version |
| --- | --- |
| 13.1.0200 | 13.1.0 Build 0.0.6 |
| 12.1.303000 | 12.1.3.3 Build 0.0.1 |
| latest | This will select the latest BIG-IP version available |

## Supported instance types and hypervisors

- For a list of supported Azure instance types for this solution, see the [Azure instances for BIG-IP VE](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/azure/Azure_singleNIC.html#azure-instances-for-big-ip-ve).

### Programmatic deployments

As an alternative to deploying through the Azure Portal (GUI) each solution provides example scripts to deploy the ARM template.  The example commands can be found below along with the name of the script file, which exists in the current directory.

#### PowerShell Script Example

```powershell
## Example Command: .\Deploy_via_PS.ps1 -licenseType PAYG -licensedBandwidth 200m -adminUsername azureuser -adminPassword <value> -dnsLabel <value> -instanceName f5vm01 -instanceType Standard_DS2_v2 -imageName Good -bigIpVersion 13.1.0200 -numberOfExternalIps 1 -vnetName <value> -vnetResourceGroupName <value> -mgmtSubnetName <value> -mgmtIpAddress <value> -externalSubnetName <value> -externalIpAddressRangeStart <value> -avSetChoice CREATE_NEW -ntpServer 0.pool.ntp.org -timeZone UTC -allowUsageAnalytics Yes -resourceGroupName <value>
```

=======

#### Azure CLI (1.0) Script Example

```bash
## Example Command: ./deploy_via_bash.sh --licenseType PAYG --licensedBandwidth 200m --adminUsername azureuser --adminPassword <value> --dnsLabel <value> --instanceName f5vm01 --instanceType Standard_DS2_v2 --imageName Good --bigIpVersion 13.1.0200 --numberOfExternalIps 1 --vnetName <value> --vnetResourceGroupName <value> --mgmtSubnetName <value> --mgmtIpAddress <value> --externalSubnetName <value> --externalIpAddressRangeStart <value> --avSetChoice CREATE_NEW --ntpServer 0.pool.ntp.org --timeZone UTC --allowUsageAnalytics Yes --resourceGroupName <value> --azureLoginUser <value> --azureLoginPassword <value>
```

## Configuration Example

The following is an example configuration diagram for this solution deployment. In this scenario, one NIC is for management and one NIC is for external traffic.  This is a more traditional BIG-IP deployment model where data-plane and management traffic is separate. The IP addresses in this example may be different in your implementation.

![Configuration Example](images/azure-example-diagram.png)

## Post-Deployment Configuration

Use this section for optional configuration changes after you have deployed the template.

### Additional public IP addresses

This ARM template supports using up to 20 public IP addresses.  After you initially deployed the template, if you now want to include additional public IP addresses, use the following guidance.

#### Adding additional public IP addresses to the deployment

The deployment template supports creation of 1-20 external public IP addresses for application traffic (first one is used for external NIC Self IP).  Follow the steps below to add **additional** public IP addresses to the deployment:

- Create a new Azure public IP address resource in the deployment resource group
- Create a new, secondary IP configuration resource (for example: *myResourceGroupName-ext-ipconfig9*) in the properties of the external Azure network interface (for example: *myResourceGroupName-ext0*)

When you create virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE for these additional addresses, the BIG-IP network virtual server destination IP address should match the private IP addresses of both secondary Azure IP configurations assigned to the backend pool that is referenced by the application's Azure load balancing rule.

## Documentation

For more information on F5 solutions for Azure, including manual configuration procedures for some deployment scenarios, see the Azure section of [Public Cloud Docs](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/).

### Service Discovery

Once you launch your BIG-IP instance using the ARM template, you can use the Service Discovery iApp template on the BIG-IP VE to automatically update pool members based on auto-scaled cloud application hosts.  In the iApp template, you enter information about your cloud environment, including the tag key and tag value for the pool members you want to include, and then the BIG-IP VE programmatically discovers (or removes) members using those tags.  See our [Service Discovery video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig_pQ_tqvsI) to see this feature in action.

#### Tagging

In Microsoft Azure, you have three options for tagging objects that the Service Discovery iApp uses. Note that you select public or private IP addresses within the iApp.

- *Tag a VM resource*

The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the primary NIC configured for the tagged VM.

- *Tag a NIC resource*

The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the tagged NIC.  Use this option if you want to use the secondary NIC of a VM in the pool.

- *Tag a Virtual Machine Scale Set resource*

The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary private IP address for the primary NIC configured for each Scale Set instance.  Note you must select Private IP addresses in the iApp template if you are tagging a Scale Set.

The iApp first looks for NIC resources with the tags you specify.  If it finds NICs with the proper tags, it does not look for VM resources. If it does not find NIC resources, it looks for VM resources with the proper tags. In either case, it then looks for Scale Set resources with the proper tags.

**Important**: Make sure the tags and IP addresses you use are unique. You should not tag multiple Azure nodes with the same key/tag combination if those nodes use the same IP address.

To launch the template:

1. From the BIG-IP VE web-based Configuration utility, on the Main tab, click **iApps > Application Services > Create**.
2. In the **Name** field, give the template a unique name.
3. From the **Template** list, select **f5.service_discovery**.  The template opens.
4. Complete the template with information from your environment.  For assistance, from the Do you want to see inline help? question, select Yes, show inline help.
5. When you are done, click the **Finished** button.

## Creating virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE

In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers through the BIG-IP system, you must create a virtual server on the BIG-IP VE. To create a BIG-IP virtual server you need to know the private IP address of the IP configuration(s) for each BIG-IP VE network interface created by the template. If you need additional virtual servers for your applications/servers, you can add more secondary IP configurations on the Azure network interface, and corresponding virtual servers on the BIG-IP system. See [virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal) for information on multiple IP addresses.
**Important**: For 1 NIC BIG-IP VEs, the virtual server configuration uses a wildcard destination address (example: 0.0.0.0/0) and should use different ports (if behind an ALB) or hostnames to differentiate services.

### To create virtual servers on the BIG-IP system

1. Once your BIG-IP VE has launched, open the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.
2. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and then click the **Create** button.
3. In the **Name** field, give the Virtual Server a unique name.
4. In the **Destination/Mask** field, type the Azure secondary private IP address.
5. In the **Service Port** field, type the appropriate port.
6. Configure the rest of the virtual server as appropriate.
7. If you used the Service Discovery iApp template: In the Resources section, from the **Default Pool** list, select the name of the pool created by the iApp.
8. Click the **Finished** button.
9. Repeat as necessary.

### Deploying Custom Configuration to the BIG-IP (Azure Virtual Machine)

Once the solution has been deployed there may be a need to perform some additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  This can be accomplished via traditional methods such as via the GUI, logging into the CLI or using the REST API.  However, depending on the requirements it might be preferred to perform this custom configuration as a part of the initial deployment of the solution.  This can be accomplished in the below manner.

Within the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template there is a variable called **customConfig**, this contains text similar to "### START(INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION", that can be replaced with custom shell scripting to perform additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  An example of what it would look like to configure the f5.ip_forwarding iApp is included below.

Warning: F5 does not support the template if you change anything other than the **customConfig** ARM template variable.

```json
"variables": {
    "customConfig": "### START (INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION HERE\ntmsh create sys application service my_deployment { device-group none template f5.ip_forwarding traffic-group none variables replace-all-with { basic__addr { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__forward_all { value No } basic__mask { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__port { value 0 } basic__vlan_listening { value default } options__advanced { value no }options__display_help { value hide } } }"
}
```

### Changing the BIG-IP Configuration utility (GUI) port

Depending on the deployment requirements, the default management port for the BIG-IP may need to be changed. To change the Management port, see [Changing the Configuration utility port](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-0-0/2.html#GUID-3E6920CD-A8CD-456C-AC40-33469DA6922E) for instructions.

***Important***: The default port provisioned is dependent on 1) which BIG-IP version you choose to deploy as well as 2) how many interfaces (NICs) are configured on that BIG-IP. BIG-IP v13.x and later in a single-NIC configuration uses port 8443. All prior BIG-IP versions default to 443 on the MGMT interface.

***Important***: If you perform the procedure to change the port, you must check the Azure Network Security Group associated with the interface on the BIG-IP that was deployed and adjust the ports accordingly.

### Logging iApp

F5 has created an iApp for configuring logging for BIG-IP modules to be sent to a specific set of cloud analytics solutions. The iApp creates logging profiles which can be attached to the appropriate objects (virtual servers, APM policy, and so on) which results in logs being sent to the selected cloud analytics solution, Azure in this case.

We recommend you watch the [Viewing ASM Data in Azure Analytics video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3B_TOG5ZpA&feature=youtu.be) that shows this iApp in action, everything from downloading and importing the iApp, to configuring it, to a demo of an attack on an application and the resulting ASM violation log that is sent to ASM Analytics.

**Important**: Be aware that this may (depending on the level of logging required) affect performance of the BIG-IP as a result of the processing to construct and send the log messages over HTTP to the cloud analytics solution.
It is also important to note this cloud logging iApp template is a *different solution and iApp template* than the F5 Analytics iApp template described [here](https://f5.com/solutions/deployment-guides/analytics-big-ip-v114-v1212-ltm-apm-aam-asm-afm).

Use the following guidance using the iApp template (the iApp now is present on the BIG-IP VE image as a part of the templates).

1. Log on to the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.
2. On the Main tab, from the **iApp** menu, click **Application Services > Applications > Create**.
3. From the **Template** list, select f5.cloud_logger.v1.0.0.tmpl (or later version if applicable).

For assistance running the iApp template, once you open the iApp, from the *Do you want to see inline help?* question, select **Yes, show inline help**.

### Sending statistical information to F5

All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the customer ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- Azure region
- BIG-IP version
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name

This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent to F5.

## Security Details

This section has the code snippet for each the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.
