## Introduction

This solution uses an ARM template to launch the deployment of F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) Virtual Edition (VE) instances in a Microsoft Azure VM Scale Set that is configured for auto scaling. Traffic flows from the Azure load balancer to the BIG-IP VE (cluster) and then to the application servers. The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in single-NIC mode. As traffic increases or decreases, the number of BIG-IP VE LTM instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly.  Scaling thresholds are currently based on *network out* throughput. This solution is for BIG-IP LTM only.

**Networking Stack Type:** This template deploys into an existing networking stack; the networking infrastructure must be available prior to deploying. See the [Template Parameters Section](#template-parameters) for required networking objects.

## Prerequisites
  - **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873 for details.
  - If you are deploying the BYOL template, you must have a valid BIG-IP license token.
  - This template requires service principal.  See the [Service Principal Setup section](#service-principal-authentication) for details.

## Important configuration notes
  - See the **[Configuration Example](#config)** section for a configuration diagram and description for this solution.
  - See the important note about [optionally changing the BIG-IP Management port](#changing-the-big-ip-configuration-utility-gui-port).
  - This template supports service discovery.  See the [Service Discovery section](#service-discovery) for details.
  - This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
  - In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template, you must create virtual server(s) on the BIG-IP VE.  See [Creating a virtual server](#creating-virtual-servers-on-the-big-ip-ve).
  - F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 ARM templates for Microsoft Azure and the corresponding BIG-IP versions, license types and throughputs available for a specific tagged release. See https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/azure-bigip-version-matrix.md.
  - This template includes a master election feature, which ensures that if the existing master BIG-IP VE is unavailable, a new master is selected from the BIG-IP VEs in the cluster.
  - This template has some optional post-deployment configuration.  See the [Post-Deployment Configuration section](#post-deployment-configuration) for details.
  - After deploying the template, if you make manual changes to the BIG-IP configuration, you must see [this section](#backup-big-ip-configuration-for-cluster-recovery).


## Security
This ARM template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the template and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#securitydetail) for the exact code.
In the *variables* section:
  - In the *verifyHash* variable: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature.
  - In the *installCloudLibs* variable: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
  - In the *installCloudLibs* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.


Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014.

## Supported BIG-IP versions
The following is a map that shows the available options for the template parameter **bigIpVersion** as it corresponds to the BIG-IP version itself. Only the latest version of BIG-IP VE is posted in the Azure Marketplace. For older versions, see downloads.f5.com.

### Help
While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the **experimental** directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.

We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 ARM templates.  This channel is typically monitored Monday-Friday 9-5 PST by F5 employees who will offer best-effort support.


## Installation

You have three options for deploying this solution:
  - Using the Azure deploy buttons
  - Using [PowerShell](#powershell)
  - Using [CLI Tools](#cli)

### <a name="azure"></a>Azure deploy buttons

Use the appropriate button, depending on what type of BIG-IP licensing required:
   - **PAYG**: This allows you to use pay-as-you-go hourly billing. <br><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FF5Networks%2Ff5-azure-arm-templates%2Fencrypt%2Fexperimental%2Fsolutions%2Fautoscale%2Fltm%2Fexisting_stack%2FPAYG%2Fazuredeploy.json">
    <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a><br><br>

   - **BIG-IQ**: This allows you to launch the template using an existing BIG-IQ device with a pool of licenses to license the BIG-IP VE(s). <br><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FF5Networks%2Ff5-azure-arm-templates%2Fencrypt%2Fexperimental%2Fsolutions%2Fautoscale%2Fltm%2Fexisting_stack%2FBIGIQ%2Fazuredeploy.json">

| vmScaleSetMaxCount | Yes | The maximum number of BIG-IP VEs that can be deployed into the VM Scale Set. |
| autoScaleMetric | Yes | Select the metric you would like the auto scale events to be triggered on, the following parameters determine individual settings for the scaling rules based on the metric chosen. Note: Custom BIG-IP metrics will be sent to Application Insights regardless of metric selected, for use by additional autoscale rules or for device visibility. |
| appInsights | Yes | Enter the name of your existing Application Insights environment that will be used to receive custom BIG-IP metrics that can be used for Scale Set rules and device visibility. If it is in a different Resource Group than this deployment, specify it as **app_insights_name;app_insights_rg**).  If you do not have an Application Insights environment, leave the default (CREATE_NEW) and the template will create one. Note: By default, the new Application Insights environment will be created in **East US**, if necessary you can specify a different region as **CREATE_NEW:app_insights_region**). |

```

## Configuration Example <a name="config">

The following is an example configuration diagram for this solution deployment. In this scenario, all access to the BIG-IP VE appliance is through an Azure Load Balancer. The Azure Load Balancer processes both management and data plane traffic into the BIG-IP VEs, which then distribute the traffic to web/application servers according to normal F5 patterns.

![Configuration Example](images/azure-example-diagram.png)

## Post-Deployment Configuration
This solution deploys an ARM template that fully configures BIG-IP VE(s) and handles clustering (DSC) and Azure creation of objects needed for management of those BIG-IP VEs.  However, once deployed the assumption is configuration will be performed on the BIG-IP VE(s) to create virtual servers, pools, and other objects used for processing application traffic.  An example of the steps required to add an application are listed [here](#post-deployment-application-configuration).

### Backup BIG-IP configuration for cluster recovery
After you initially launch the template, if you make manual changes to the BIG-IP configuration, you must make a backup of your BIG-IP configuration and store the resulting UCS file in the **backup** container of the storage account ending in **data000** created by the template to ensure the master election process will include the custom configuration in the cluster in the event of failure. Note: If necessary to recover from this UCS it will pick the one with the latest timestamp.
  1. Backup your BIG-IP configuration (ideally the cluster primary) by creating a [UCS](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132) archive.  Use the following syntax to save the backup UCS file:
     - From the CLI command: ```# tmsh save /sys ucs /var/tmp/original.ucs```
     - From the Configuration utility: **System > Archives > Create**
  2. Upload the UCS into the **backup** container of the storage account ending in **data000** (it is a Blob container).

### Post-deployment application configuration
Note: Steps are for an example application on port 443
  1. Add a "Health Probe" to the ALB (Azure Load Balancer) for port 443, you can choose TCP or HTTP depending on your needs.  This queries each BIG-IP at that port to determine if it is available for traffic.
  2. Add a "Load Balancing Rule" to the ALB where the port is 443 and the backend port is also 443 (assuming you are using same port on the BIG-IP), make sure the backend pool is selected (there should only be one backend pool which was created and is managed by the VM Scale set)
  3. Add an "Inbound Security Rule" to the Network Security Group (NSG) for port 443 as the NSG is added to the subnet where the BIG-IP VE(s) are deployed - You could optionally just remove the NSG from the subnet as the VM Scale Set is fronted by the ALB.

### Additional Optional Configuration Items
Here are some post-deployment options that are entirely optional but could be useful based on your needs.

#### BIG-IP Lifecycle Management
As new BIG-IP versions are released, existing VM scale sets can be upgraded to use those new images. In an existing implementation, we assume you have created different types of BIG-IP configuration objects (such as virtual servers, pools, and monitors), and you want to retain this BIG-IP configuration after an upgrade. This section describes the process of upgrading and retaining the configuration.

When this ARM template was initially deployed, a storage account was created in the same Resource Group as the VM scale set. This account name ends with **data000*** (the name of storage accounts have to be globally unique, so the prefix is a unique string). In this storage account, the template created a container named **backup**.  We use this backup container to hold backup [UCS](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13132) configuration files. Once the UCS is present in the container, you update the scale set "model" to use the newer BIG-IP version. Once the scale set is updated, you upgrade the BIG-IP VE(s). As a part of this upgrade, the provisioning checks the backup container for a UCS file and if one exists, it uploads the configuration (if more than one exists, it uses the latest).

**To upgrade the BIG-IP VE Image**
  1. Backup configuration as outlined [here](#backup-big-ip-configuration-for-cluster-recovery)
  3. Update the VM Scale Set Model to the new BIG-IP version
     - From PowerShell: Use the PowerShell script in the **scripts** folder in this directory
     - Using the Azure redeploy functionality: From the Resource Group where the ARM template was initially deployed, click the successful deployment and then select to redeploy the template. If necessary, re-select all the same variables, and **only change** the BIG-IP version to the latest.
  4. Upgrade the Instances
     1. In Azure, navigate to the VM Scale Set instances pane and verify the *Latest model* does not say **Yes** (it should have a caution sign instead of the word Yes)
     2. Select either all instances at once or each instance one at a time (starting with instance ID 0 and working up).
     3. Click the **Upgrade** action button.

#### Configure Scale Event Notifications
You can add notifications when scale up/down events happen, either in the form of email or webhooks. The following shows an example of adding an email address that receives an email from Azure whenever a scale up/down event occurs.

Log in to the [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com) and then navigate to the Auto Scale settings (**Subscriptions > Resource Groups >** *resource group where deployed* **> Providers > Microsoft.Insights > Autoscalesettings > autoscaleconfig**).  At the top of the screen click Read/Write, and then from the Auto Scale settings, click **Edit**.  Replace the current **notifications** json key with the example below, making sure to update the email address(es). Select PUT and notifications will be sent to the email addresses listed.

```json
    "notifications": [
      {
        "operation": "Scale",
        "email": {
          "sendToSubscriptionAdministrator": false,
          "sendToSubscriptionCoAdministrators": false,
          "customEmails": [
            "email@f5.com"
          ]
        },
        "webhooks": null
      }
    ]
```

## Documentation

The ***BIG-IP Virtual Edition and Microsoft Azure: Setup*** guide (https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-1-0.html) describes how to create a single NIC and multi-NIC BIG-IP without using an ARM template.

### Service Discovery
Once you launch your BIG-IP instance using the ARM template, you can use the Service Discovery iApp template on the BIG-IP VE to automatically update pool members based on auto-scaled cloud application hosts.  In the iApp template, you enter information about your cloud environment, including the tag key and tag value for the pool members you want to include, and then the BIG-IP VE programmatically discovers (or removes) members using those tags.

#### Tagging
In Microsoft Azure, you have three options for tagging objects that the Service Discovery iApp uses. Note that you select public or private IP addresses within the iApp.
  - *Tag a VM resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the primary NIC configured for the tagged VM.
  - *Tag a NIC resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary public or private IP addresses for the tagged NIC.  Use this option if you want to use the secondary NIC of a VM in the pool.
  - *Tag a Virtual Machine Scale Set resource*<br>
The BIG-IP VE will discover the primary private IP address for the primary NIC configured for each Scale Set instance.  Note you must select Private IP addresses in the iApp template if you are tagging a Scale Set.

The iApp first looks for NIC resources with the tags you specify.  If it finds NICs with the proper tags, it does not look for VM resources. If it does not find NIC resources, it looks for VM resources with the proper tags. In either case, it then looks for Scale Set resources with the proper tags.

**Important**: Make sure the tags and IP addresses you use are unique. You should not tag multiple Azure nodes with the same key/tag combination if those nodes use the same IP address.

To launch the template:
  1.	From the BIG-IP VE web-based Configuration utility, on the Main tab, click **iApps > Application Services > Create**.
  2.	In the **Name** field, give the template a unique name.
  3.	From the **Template** list, select **f5.service_discovery**.  The template opens.
  4.	Complete the template with information from your environment.  For assistance, from the Do you want to see inline help? question, select Yes, show inline help.
  5.	When you are done, click the **Finished** button.

### Service Principal Authentication
This solution requires access to the Azure API to determine how the BIG-IP VEs should be configured.  The most efficient and security-conscious way to handle this is to utilize Azure service principal authentication, for all the typical security reasons.  The following provides information/links on the options for configuring a service principal within Azure if this is the first time it is needed in a subscription.

_Ensure that however the creation of the service principal occurs to verify it only has minimum required access based on the solutions need(read vs read/write) prior to this template being deployed and used by the solution within the resource group selected(new or existing)._

**Minimum Required Access:** **Read** access is required, it can be limited to the resource group used by this solution.

The end result should be possession of a client (application) ID, tenant ID and service principal secret that can login to the same subscription this template will be deployed into.  Ensuring this is fully functioning prior to deploying this ARM template will save on some troubleshooting post-deployment if the service principal is in fact not fully configured.

#### 1. Azure Portal

Follow the steps outlined in the [Azure Portal documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/) to generate the service principal.

#### 2. Azure CLI

This method can be used with either the [Azure CLI v2.0 (Python)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) or the [Azure Cross-Platform CLI (npm module)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli).

_Using the Python Azure CLI v2.0 - requires just one step_
```shell
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac
```

_Using the Node.js cross-platform CLI - requires additional steps for setting up_
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli

#### 3. Azure PowerShell
Follow the steps outlined in the [Azure Powershell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal) to generate the service principal.

## Creating virtual servers on the BIG-IP VE

In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers through the BIG-IP system, you must create a virtual server on the BIG-IP VE. To create a BIG-IP virtual server you need to know the private IP address of the IP configuration(s) for each BIG-IP VE network interface created by the template. If you need additional virtual servers for your applications/servers, you can add more secondary IP configurations on the Azure network interface, and corresponding virtual servers on the BIG-IP system. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal for information on multiple IP addresses.
**Important**: For 1 NIC BIG-IP VEs, the virtual server configuration uses a wildcard destination address (example: 0.0.0.0/0) and should use different ports (if behind an ALB) or hostnames to differentiate services.

**To create virtual servers on the BIG-IP system**

1. Once your BIG-IP VE has launched, open the BIG-IP VE Configuration utility.
2. On the Main tab, click **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and then click the **Create** button.
3. In the **Name** field, give the Virtual Server a unique name.
4. In the **Destination/Mask** field, type the Azure secondary private IP address.
5. In the **Service Port** field, type the appropriate port. 
6. Configure the rest of the virtual server as appropriate.
7. If you used the Service Discovery iApp template: <br>In the Resources section, from the **Default Pool** list, select the name of the pool created by the iApp.
8. Click the **Finished** button.
9. Repeat as necessary.

## Deploying Custom Configuration to the BIG-IP (Azure Virtual Machine)

Once the solution has been deployed there may be a need to perform some additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  This can be accomplished via traditional methods such as via the GUI, logging into the CLI or using the REST API.  However, depending on the requirements it might be preferred to perform this custom configuration as a part of the initial deployment of the solution.  This can be accomplished in the below manner.

Within the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template there is a variable called **customConfig**, this contains text similar to "### START(INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION", that can be replaced with custom shell scripting to perform additional configuration of the BIG-IP.  An example of what it would look like to configure the f5.ip_forwarding iApp is included below.

Warning: F5 does not support the template if you change anything other than the **customConfig** ARM template variable.

```json
"variables": {
    "customConfig": "### START (INPUT) CUSTOM CONFIGURATION HERE\ntmsh create sys application service my_deployment { device-group none template f5.ip_forwarding traffic-group none variables replace-all-with { basic__addr { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__forward_all { value No } basic__mask { value 0.0.0.0 } basic__port { value 0 } basic__vlan_listening { value default } options__advanced { value no }options__display_help { value hide } } }"
}
```
### Changing the BIG-IP Configuration utility (GUI) port
Depending on the deployment requirements, the default management port for the BIG-IP may need to be changed. To change the Management port, see [Changing the Configuration utility port](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-ve-setup-msft-azure-12-0-0/2.html#GUID-3E6920CD-A8CD-456C-AC40-33469DA6922E) for instructions.<br>
***Important***: The default port provisioned is dependent on 1) which BIG-IP version you choose to deploy as well as 2) how many interfaces (NICs) are configured on that BIG-IP. BIG-IP v13.x and later in a single-NIC configuration uses port 8443. All prior BIG-IP versions default to 443 on the MGMT interface.<br>
***Important***: If you perform the procedure to change the port, you must check the Azure Network Security Group associated with the interface on the BIG-IP that was deployed and adjust the ports accordingly.

### Sending statistical information to F5
All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.  
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:  

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the customer ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- Azure region 
- BIG-IP version 
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name

This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent to F5.

## Security Details <a name="securitydetail"></a>
