## Introduction

This solution uses an experimental ARM Template to launch and configure two BIG-IQ 2-NIC VEs in a clustered, hot-standby configuration, using BYOL (bring your own license) licensing.

IIn a 2-NIC implementation, one interface is for management and one is for data-plane traffic, each with a unique public/private IP.

You can choose one or both of these types of license pools on your BIG-IQ devices for licensing your BIG-IP VE devices:
- A License (Purchase) Pool, which can either be a registration key with a particular number of licenses, or an ELA/subscription pool, which enables self-licensing of BIG-IP virtual editions (VEs).
- A Registration Key Pool, which is a pool of single standalone BIG-IP VE registration keys for one or more BIG-IP services. This enables the ability to revoke and reassign a license to BIG-IP VE systems without having to contact F5 to allow the license to be moved.

See the [BIG-IQ documentation](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-iq-centralized-mgmt/manuals/product/big-iq-centralized-management-device-6-0-1/04.html) for more information on these pool types.

For information on getting started using F5's ARM templates on GitHub, see [Microsoft Azure: Solutions 101](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/azure/Azure_solutions101.html).

**Networking Stack Type:** This template deploys into an existing networking stack; so the networking infrastructure MUST be available prior to deploying. See the [Template Parameters Section](#template-parameters) for required networking objects.

## Prerequisites

- **Important**: When you configure the admin password for the BIG-IP VE in the template, you cannot use the character **#**.  Additionally, there are a number of other special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See [K2873](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873) for details.
- Before deploying this template, you must create a managed identity to allow BIG-IQ to migrate IP configurations to the network interface of the active device on failover.  You must also create a **Contributor** role assignment for this identity with a scope that includes the resource group where the existing stack virtual network is configured. When deploying the template, use the identity name from these examples for the **userAssignedIdentityName** input parameter.

Click one of the following links for guidance on creating the managed identity:
	- [Azure Portal](#creating-a-managed-user-identity-from-the-azure-portal)
	- [Azure CLI](#creating-a-managed-user-identity-from-the-azure-cli)

- The following are prerequisites and notes for the F5 2-NIC ARM Template:

- Management subnet: the subnet for the management network requires a route and access to the Internet for the initial configuration to download the BIG-IP cloud library.
- Internal subnet.

- Since you are deploying the BYOL template, you must have a valid BIG-IP license token.
- The master-key (the passphrase used to establish trust between a future HA pair) for this deployment.

## Important configuration notes

- This template creates Azure Security Groups as a part of the deployment. For the internal Security Group, this includes a port for accessing BIG-IQ on port 443.
- This solution uses the SSH key to enable access to the BIG-IQ system. If you want access to the BIG-IQ web-based Configuration utility, you must first SSH into the BIG-IQ VE using the SSH key you provided in the template.  You can then create a user account with admin-level permissions on the BIG-IQ VE to allow access if necessary.
- This solution uses SKU with BIG-IQ v6.0.1 or later.
- After deploying the template, if you need to change your BIG-IQ VE password, there are a number of special characters that you should avoid using for F5 product user accounts.  See https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873 for details.
- This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates.  See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
- F5 has created a matrix that contains all of the tagged releases of the F5 ARM Templates for Microsoft Azure ARM, and the corresponding BIG-IQ versions, license types and throughput levels available for a specific tagged release. See https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/azure-bigip-version-matrix.md.
- These ARM templates incorporate an existing Virtual Network (VNet).
- F5 Azure ARM templates now capture all deployment logs to the BIG-IQ VE in /var/log/cloud/azure. Depending on which template you are using, this includes deployment logs (stdout/stderr), Cloud Libs execution logs, recurring solution logs (metrics, failover, and so on), and more.

## Security

This ARM template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IQ system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open the template and ensure the following lines are present. See [Security Detail](#security-details) for the exact code.
In the *variables* section:

- In the *verifyHash* variable: **script-signature** and then a hashed signature.
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: **tmsh load sys config merge file /config/verifyHash**.
- In the *installCloudLibs* variable: ensure this includes **tmsh run cli script verifyHash /config/cloud/f5-cloud-libs.tar.gz**.

Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see [checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github](https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014).

## Supported BIG-IP versions

The following is a map that shows the available options for the template parameter **bigIqVersion** as it corresponds to the BIG-IQ version itself. Only the latest version of BIG-IQ VE is posted in the Azure Marketplace. For older versions, see downloads.f5.com.


## Supported instance types and hypervisors

- For a list of recommended Azure instance types for the BIG-IQ VE, see https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-iq-centralized-mgmt/manuals/product/bigiq-ve-supported-hypervisors-matrix.html.

## Getting Help

While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the **experimental** directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.

### Community Help

We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 ARM templates. There are F5 employees who are members of this community who typically monitor the channel Monday-Friday 9-5 PST and will offer best-effort assistance. This slack channel community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support for supported templates. See the [Slack Channel Statement](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-azure-arm-templates/blob/master/slack-channel-statement.md) for guidelines on using this channel.

- For more information on F5 solutions for Azure, including manual configuration procedures for some deployment scenarios, see the Azure section of [Public Cloud Docs](http://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/).

## Creating a managed user identity
Use one of the following procedures to create a managed user identity.


### Creating a managed user identity from the Azure Portal
Use the following procedure if you want to create the managed user identity from the Azure Portal.

1.	Click the Azure Resource Group where you want to add the Managed User Identity.
2.	Click **Add**.
3.	Type **User Assigned Managed Identity** in the search bar.
4.	Click **User Assigned Managed Identity** and then click **Create**.
5.	Specify a name for the resource and choose a Resource Group where it will be created, and then click **Create**.
6.	Click the Azure Resource Group containing your existing Azure virtual network.
7.	Click **Access Control (IAM)**.
8.	Click **Role Assignments**.
9.	Click **Add > Role Assignment**.
10.	Under **Role**, select the **Contributor** role.
11.	Under **Assign access to**, select **User assigned managed identity**.
12.	Select the User assigned managed identity you created previously, and click **Save**
13. Repeat steps 6-12 for the Resource Group where you deployed the ARM template

The BIG-IQ system now has access to move Azure IP configurations to the active device.

### Creating a managed user identity from the Azure CLI
Use the following procedure if you want to create the managed user identity from the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest).

- To create a managed identity, use the following command syntax from the Azure CLI:
```az identity create -n <identity_name> -g <deployment_resource_group>```
- To get the object ID of the identity (the object ID is the "value" property (GUID) of the returned JSON object), use the following command syntax from the Azure CLI:
```az identity show -g <deployment_resource_group> --name <identity_name> --output json```
- To create a role assignment for the identity on the existing stack resource group, use the following command syntax from the Azure CLI:
    ```az role assignment create --resource-group <existing_stack_resource_group> <identity_object_ID> --roleName "Contributor"```


### Sending statistical information to F5

All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the customer ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- Azure region
- BIG-IQ version
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name

This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent to F5.

## Security Details

This section has the code snippet for each the lines you should ensure are present in your template file if you want to verify the integrity of the helper code in the template.

Note the hashed script-signature may be different in your template.
